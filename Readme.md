## Razorpay Integration

The donation process is handled through Razorpay. In the `donatepage` view:

- A payment order is created using Razorpay's API.
- The amount is calculated in paisa (â‚¹1 = 100 paisa).
- The payment form is rendered with Razorpay's payment button.

## Templates

- **`homepage.html`**: The landing page for the application.
- **`detailspage.html`**: The form where users provide their donation details.
- **`donatepage.html`**: Contains the Razorpay payment button and order details.
